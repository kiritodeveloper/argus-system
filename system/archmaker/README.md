# ArchMaker
> Quickly and easily create your own arch-based GNU/Linux-distribution.

ArchMaker is a program that generates scripts which then can generate an iso-file of your own distribution.

You just have to select the programs you want to install, an /etc/skel-folder, enter some information and select a slideshow. It uses archiso to generate the ISO-file and [Calamares](https://www.calamares.io) as the installer.

## Dependencies

* **Arch Linux (64 bit)** - base-devel
* git
* QT5
* archiso (runtime)
* xterm (runtime)

## Installation

### Building

To get the dependencies:
```sh
sudo pacman -S base-devel git qt5-base archiso xterm
```
Now you need to clone the Github-Repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/guidedlinux/archmaker.git && cd archmaker
```
After that you can compile ArchMaker:
```sh
mkdir build && cd build
qmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

This will install the .desktop file into /usr/share/applications/

### From the AUR (outdated)

To build the package from the AUR, it is recommended to use an AUR-Helper (e.g. yaourt, pacaur). Then you can run:
```sh
yaourt -S archmaker
```
or
```sh
pacaur -S archmaker
```
## Sharing your distro

When you have generated your iso, you can upload it (anywhere) and share the link at [the gallery](https://archmaker.guidedlinux.org/gallery/).
